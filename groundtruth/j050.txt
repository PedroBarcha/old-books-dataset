strand of sufficient size. It requires little soaking to make it ready for use. Raffia produces an even, smooth surface of pleasing appearance, and is very desirable in a seat.
Fiber may be woven as it comes from the spool. However, it is better to dampen it by plunging a quantity in water and removing

at once. When it dries after weaving, a slight shrinkage results, thereby making a tauter seat than could be woven with dry strands. Inasmuch as the fiber is paper, it cannot be soaked in water.
The Weaving Process.—With the frame ready and rush in proper condition the weaving may be started. Fig. 39 shows an isometric drawing on which corners are lettered and the rails numbered in order. Fig. 40 shows another drawing on which the corners and rails are similarly lettered and numbered, showing graphically the method of weaving the first strand. The arrows indicate the direction of weave. The operation is practically complete once around the frame. Reference may be made to either drawing in the following detailed directions for weaving.
Start arbitrarily at any corner—in this case, A. A strand of rush tightly twisted is laid over rail 1 next to the cap with its short end turned down. The beginner may find it advantageous to tack
