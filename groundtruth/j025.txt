In weaving the diagonals it is frequently necessary to run several in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just when this should be done can only be determined by the worker. A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of

It is neat in appearance and is much simpler than seven-step caning.

Fig. 12 illustrates a frame caned with the five steps. The distance between holes was purposely made greater than usual, to show the weave clearly. The first strands are strung in, in the same manner as described in the seven steps. The second series of
