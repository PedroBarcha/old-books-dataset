The leaves are tied in loose bundles for convenience in handling, and dried in the shade, preferably a darkened room. They should remain here until thoroly dry. Before using, soak the rush about ten hours in water. Less time is required if warm water is used. When it is soft and pliable it is ready for weaving.

In fact, twisting need not be done underneath at all unless the individual worker so desires.
Raffia is easy to manipulate because of its pliability, even when dry. Several lengths will need to be twisted together to produce a
