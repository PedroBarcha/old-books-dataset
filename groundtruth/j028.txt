24	SEAT WEAVING

Figs. 13, 14, 15, and 17 show pieces of furniture made in manual training shops by eighth grade boys. These pieces comprise a group, with the addition of the leg rest shown in Fig. 2 for a library or living room. The cane in each instance adds materially to the artistic effect of the problems; they have tone. The cane forms pleasing groups well related to the wood mass. The cane is natural, the wood fumed and finished flat. The two tones of color are in perfect harmony.
FIG. 16. LIBRARY TABLE.	FIG. 17. TABLE. SIDES CANED.

Fig. 16 shows a library table of oak constructed by an eighth grade boy. The lines are very pleasing and the long vertical caned panel adds a distinct note to the structure even tho purely decorative.

Many modifications of the standard weave in caning are in vogue, but are more or less fads. A “rotary” weave is rather prevalent on certain types of furniture, as is what may be termed the “spider-web” weave. These are mentioned merely to suggest that caning is subject to variation. However, the standard weave, of seven steps, will not be supplanted to any appreciable degree, for it adapts itself to almost all types of furniture both decoratively and structurally.
