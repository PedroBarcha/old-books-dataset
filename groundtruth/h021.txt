Preface.-Introduction. IX

THE OLD BIBLE.

Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor, Barnabas, is the old Bible, which he brought with him from England. It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold. It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and carefully repaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire, and in a good condition.
We find in it the following record:
"Imprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker."
Printer to the Queen's Most Excellent Majestie, 1597.

Then follows in manuscript:
"Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this Bible he did bequeath, in the year of our Lord, 1680."

"The Word of the Lord God of Jonathan Horton, 1748-'49."

"Lydia Tuthill, her Book, given her by her mother, as it is said."
And then follows:
"Feb. 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this life—the son of Henry Tuthill and Bethia (Horton) Tuthill. Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan Tuthill, departed this life May 16, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age. Henry Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in the year 1750, aged 84. Bethia Tuthill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed this life March 16th, 1744, in the 73d year of her age."
OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.

The old wood hooks are still attached to the big beam of the old house, upon which Barnabas used to hang his old musket, which was called "uncle Barney's quart pot." He brought it with him from England. It is now in the possession of Barnabas B. Horton, of
