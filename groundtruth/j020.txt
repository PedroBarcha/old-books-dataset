16	SEAT WEAVING

wide is cut coincident with the holes before weaving is begun. After the area is caned the strips are fitted and glued in. Use little glue. Tap the splines firmly with a mallet used over a block of wood, until they are flush with the woven cane. Chapter IV gives the method in detail.

The size of the holes and the distance between them is determined largely by the size of the cane used. Some prefer coarse meshed areas, while others desire them closely woven. There is, however, what we may term a standard mesh. The individual may vary the dimensions given to suit himself. The Jacobean or early caning was invariably of coarse mesh.
Carriage and superfine cane require ⅛ in. holes and ⅜ in. spaces; fine-fine cane requires ³⁄16 in. holes and ½ in. spaces; fine cane requires ³⁄16 in. holes and ⅝ in. spaces; medium, ¼ in. holes and ¾ in. spaces. Fine-fine and fine cane are the best sizes for shop use. A small amount of medium binder is desirable.

One hank of cane will ordinarily be sufficient for a half-dozen areas of approximately 12 in. by 12 in.

Most old pieces of period furniture utilizing cane employ a particularly narrow split horizontally and vertically, and a wider split diagonally. The opposite practice may be employed—a finer split of cane being used diagonally than horizontally and vertically. Both effects are pleasing.
