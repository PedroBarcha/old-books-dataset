the other. Considerable force needs to be exerted in packing, and caution used to avoid breaking strands.
Rectangular Seats.—As stated, in weaving a square seat the initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled. In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fill before

hose on the long rails. Weaving around corners is then manifestly impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven seat with the short rails filled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way. The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the frame opening and up thru, then across the remaining distance, and over and under the other long rail. Repeat until the seat is completed. Fig. 43 is a sketch of a partly woven seat, illustrating the method of filling in the center just described. It supplements the photograph and makes the method clearer.
It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center must be compressed one-half of their diameters. They will need to be tapped sharply with a small mallet or hammer to produce proper crowding. Fig. 44 shows a stool seat of fiber woven by an eighth grade boy. Fig. 45 shows the complete stool. The seat is woven
