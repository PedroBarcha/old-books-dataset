40	SEAT WEAVING

erally fit the pliable spline, allow it to dry, and then insert it with the webbing. This assures tight joints. This procedure is not recommended for the ordinary shops for the simple reason that the shrinkage is not appreciable.
The frame illustrated in Fig. 35 is purely supplementary to the steps, but as with the Seven Steps in Caning, it should be used in demonstrating the processes to classes. It materially assists in making the processes clear to the students, previous to allowing work on their projects, and assures a general understanding, at least, of proper procedure. The different panels are lettered for convenience and need no elaborate explanation:

A is the open frame with grooves cut for the webbing.

B is the webbing inserted with ragged edges exposed, ready for cutting.

C is the webbing with edges properly trimmed and a spline inserted.

D is the completed panel.

Inserts of cane webbing may be utilized on pieces of furniture other than seats. These inserts could be used on every article illustrated in Chapters I and II, with similar pleasing effects, and with less labor. However, there is an obvious element in hand caning which naturally and logically gives it precedence over the inserted cane.
