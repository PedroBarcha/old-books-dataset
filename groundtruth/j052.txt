48	SEAT WEAVING

Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping improperly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where they go over the rails. To assure this, tap them sharply with a mallet used over a block of soft wood. This may be done at frequent intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail.

FIG. 42. METHOD OF FILLING IN CENTER.

Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be tight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower rows of strands is stuffed. This is done with the same material as that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are used to stuff the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffia seat; craft paper to stuff a fiber seat; and so on. The packing should be done in a thoro manner, for it builds up the seat and prevents its breaking down at the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick. It is ¾ in. in diameter at one end and tapered to ½ in. by ⅛ in. at
