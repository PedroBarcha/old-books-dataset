He was about sixteen years of age when his father moved to Colchester, Delaware County, New York, where he endured the hardships and privations incident to a frontier settlement. In 1806 he moved from Colchester to Chaumont, Jefferson Co., New York, then a dense forest. He settled permanently on Point Salubrious, being the first family of white people who ever settled there. Here he was again exposed to hardships, causing continued ill health, until his death, which occurred on 5th November, 1833. He and his wife were members of the Baptist Church. He was a warm supporter of religion and a lover of good order in society, which he always labored zealously and successfully to promote. He was temperate in his habits and exemplary in his character. He never disgraced the name he bore, and his virtues are worthy of imitation by all his posterity. He and his elder brother Henry settled near each other on Point Salubrious, which is a neck of land running out about four miles into Chamount Bay. Here they took up farms, had fine fishing grounds, and raised large families.—Letter of Van Rantz Horton.
