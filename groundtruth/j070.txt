Strand 3—Under 1, over 2, under 2, over 2, and so on.

Strand 4—Under 2, over 2, under 2, over 2, and so on.
This completes the series or unit, and this unit repeats itself until the area is woven. For instance, the fifth weaver follows the same course as the first; the sixth weaver follows the same course as the second; the seventh the same as the third; and so on. The diagonal effect will remain the same were the weaver to run over
