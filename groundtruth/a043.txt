called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ani has stood a splendid but empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagöz, which confronts Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Persians, Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinctly separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakable in characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success. After all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that true patriotism ever survives.

MATTHEVOSE EZMERLIAN.

Catholicos and Supreme Patriarch of Etchmiatzin. A man of high character and great ability, also a distinguished linguist. As Patriarch of Constantinople he was familiarly known as the “Iron Patriarch.” Banished by the Hamidian Government, he returned from exile in 1908 and was shortly after elected Catholicos of Etchmiatzin.

The Armenian Catholicos is not infallible like the Pope. He is elected by the nation, but his appointment is subject to the sanction of the Czar.
