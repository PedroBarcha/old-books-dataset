XIV Preface.-Introduction.

This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled. But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors. Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when errors are discovered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second edition may be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given their assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution to the genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very distant day.
