VIII. HON. WILLIAM, son of Daniel Horton and Esther Lane, born
at Yorktown, 10 January, 1743. In 1768, he married LIZZIE (ELIZA—
BETH) COVERT, an accomplished and amiable lady of French descent,
who was born 9 January, 1743. He removed from the town of
Sommers, formerly Stephen'town, to Colchester, Delaware Co., N. Y.,
in 1789. He was a tanner and currier by trade, and he tanned the
ﬁrst leather that was ever manufactured in Delaware Co. He pur-
chased large tracts of lands, built saw-mills and grist—mills, and carried
on a large business in the manufacture and sale of lumber and provisions,
as well as of leather. He was a healthy, muscular man. His father
died when he was sixteen, and he then for a while lived with his
brother Stephen. He was a man of sound judgment, and capable of
enduring much hardship. Colchester was an unbroken wilderness
when he settled there, but by his inﬂuence and great business capacity,
it was soon settled by an enterprising and industrious people, and the
wildness was soon turned into well cultivated and productive ﬁelds.
He was a very prominent citizen among them. He was a Justice of
the Peace for many years, and in 1794, he was sent to the Legislature,
and about this time he was President Judge of Ulster Co., Ulster and
Delaware being then one county.

He and his wife were both worthy and active members of the Baptist
Church, and they trained up their children to fear the Lord and keep
his commandments. He (lied suddenly in 1831, at the age of eighty-
eight years, respected and lamented, not only by his numerous friends
