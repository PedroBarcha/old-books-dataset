be no time to reclaim them from the purser.

I made my way back along the passage,
walking in the angle formed by the ﬂoor
and the side walls of the staterooms rather

companion-way, the same that I came down.
Going along the passage (on deck B) I
looked down some of the cross passages that
lead to the staterooms, and at the bottom of
the ones I passed I saw that the portholes
were open and that the water could not have
been more than a few feet from them. Here
let me state that I consider it most extraor-
dinary that the portholes on the lower decks
should not have been closed and sealed as we
steamed through the war zone. At luncheon
the portholes in the dining-saloon on deck
D were open, and so I doubt not that

all the others on that “deck were open.
