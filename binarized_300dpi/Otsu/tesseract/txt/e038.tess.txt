30 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

 

CHAPTER 11.

Homer the ﬁrst ethnic writer who speaks of an article of dress allied to the Corset—The
cestus or girdle of Venus—Terentius, the Roman dramatist, and his remarks on the
practice of tight-lacing—The use of the strophium by the ladies of Rome, and the

advantage, so that her husband might be charmed with her improved
