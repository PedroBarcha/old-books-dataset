FOREWORD

\Voodworking shops in manual training schools far outnumber
those for other manual activities, and as a result, courses in wood-
work have come to he termed the stable courses in a handwork
curriculum. However, experience in woodwork alone is not suf-
ficient, and needs to be supplemented by other and more varied
activities to give to the boy a proper foundation for choice of

problems and generally arouse interest and enthusiasm in the work
at hand. The result is careful application to construction details,

value such mediums have in manual training shops. Their use
produces very definite reactions upon boys who could not be reached
by woodwork alone, awakening them to a new interest in their
work and making them more workmanlike and exacting in con-
struction.

There exists some element in such mediums which cannot be
deﬁned, but which nevertheless stimulates the average or mediocre
boy, as well as the exceptional one, to produce the best work of
which he is capable. Experience with these materials utilized in
correlation with wood will prove the truth of these statements and
demonstrate that they are not only worth while, but necessary to
any well-rounded course in wood.

The originals of the projects illustrated by the photographs were,
with few exceptions, constructed by boys of average ability in the
eighth grade. They indicate the character of work which may be
