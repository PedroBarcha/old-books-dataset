That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable exeent
in school shops is due to the fact that instructors are unfamiliar
with the weaving processes. Caning is not difﬁcult. It, in common .
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation. -
However, it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study of printed directions and illustrations. If the workerv'will
closely observe his own work as it progresses, and follows instruc-‘
tions carefully, he should have no unusual difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempt. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
will find them hard to detect. V

Cane.—Cane is the name applied to a great number of plants
which possess long, slender, reedlike stems. The name should apply
only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found
thruout the Indian Archipelago, China, India, Ceylon, and the
Malay Peninsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a
matted undergrowth which makes passage difficult or impossible.
These palms are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to tree
height. They then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with beautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 100 to
300 ft., and rarely exceeds 1 in. in diameter. The stems are cut
into lengths of IO to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is stripped
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips are put
into hanks of 1,000 lineal feet each. The cane is then ready for
the cane weaver. A hank of cane costs from 60 cents to $1. The
width of the cane and its quality determines the price per hank.
It may be purchased from any upholstery supply house.
