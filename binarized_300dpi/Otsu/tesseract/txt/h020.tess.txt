than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion I Could those old walls re-
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnessed there the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from

 

the generations Of the living.

At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never
having had issue, so that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.

Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.

Mr. Stuart T. Terry, Of Southold, L. I., has kindly copied and for-
warded to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted :

“ Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called Hash-
amamock, aboute whom BARNABAS HORTON, one of ye Constables last
yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29 May, 166ng Bar-
nabas Horton was a Depuiy to the New Haven Court—also, 31 May,
1.6.541. the Deputies from Southold, presented to ye court a wrighting
from their towne, wherein it is desired that BARNABAS HORTON and
JOHN PEAKEN, the two present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen
Constables for that plantation; which was done. Barnabas Horton
was a Deputy to the Court in New Haven, in 1654—’56—’58—’59 and
1661. In 1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the
Court on public affairs. In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of Con-
necticut Colony, at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a Deputy
to the General Court, at Harford. He was a Magistrate in 1664, and
until his death. He is one of the Patentees of the Town Of Southold
in 1676.” Made his will May 10, 1680. Died 13 July, 1680. Will
proved. Lib. 2, N. Y., p. 54.—V'z?!c “II/0072”: Indexes ofSazzi/zolrl.”
