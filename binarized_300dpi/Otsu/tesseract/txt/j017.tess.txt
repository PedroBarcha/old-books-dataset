CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 13

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difﬁcult to pair the canes.
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start
le strand at any corner hole. Use one hand over and one under
1e frame. As the worker becomes skilful he will ﬁnd it easier
to give the cane a slight curve and work with both hands on the
upper surface. Use an end of cane
long enough for convenient hand-
ling; then pull the entire strand
thru the length of the frame, pro-
rided the area is not too great.
Care must be taken to avoid twist-
ing the cane. The cane will run
easily, and partially under a cane
at the corners of the squares, if cor.-
rectly done. Fig. 6 shows this
clearly, as does the illustration in
Fig. 27. The second illustration

and will supplement the freehand
sketch. The corners will bind, and the strand will pull with diﬂ'i-
culty if the cane is incorrectly woven. On parallel canes note that
the canes either run over or under the pairs.

 

Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The canes
are at right angles to the ﬁrst diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note that two strands run into the corner holes.
This holds true in all rectangular frames Where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-‘
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
