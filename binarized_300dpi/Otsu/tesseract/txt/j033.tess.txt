RESEATING A CHAIR; HAND CANING 29

different places on the seat frame. This is the result of working
to rule, and is necessary to keep strands equidistant and parallel.
At times respacing at several places will be necessary. \Vhen it is,
simply redivide into as nearly the given dimensions as possible.
After the holes have been bored and cleaned the seat is ready
for caning. Start at the center hole in the back. Pull the cane up

thru this hole and across the frame, and down the center hole in
the from. Work both ways on the frame. Fig. 19 shows a cane
started in this manner. It is best that the amateur work from the
center, both ways. He mav begin otherwise when he understands
the work better. The caning operations on the seat to be shown
are the same as those described in the seven steps in caning. They
never vary. The only new thing involved here is the shape of the
seat. Fig. 20 is a photograph of a chair seat of an odd shape, an
irregular ellipse. It shows the ﬁrst step half completed. Note here
that the last strand skips two holes, one at the front and one at.
the back. This is necessary to keep strands as nearly the same
distance apart as possible. Fig. 21 shows the ﬁrst step completed
