coils of 200 ft. each at $8.00 for 4,000 ft. The strips are a number
of feet in length. Hickory splints are sold in coils of a dozen
strands each. These strands are 8 ft. to 10 ft. long by V; in. wide,
and slightly less than 1/16 in. thick. A coil weighs about three-
fourths of a pound and costs 5 cents.

The ash splints particularly, need to be restripped to widths
needed by the worker. For ordinary purposes the hickory strips
are right for seating purposes. The stripping is done by means of
a combination hand stripper and gage shown in Fig. 50. A work-
ing drawing of it is shown in Fig. 51. It is made of maple pref-
erably. The cutters are of a watch spring, pointed and sharpened
as indicated. The end piece is removable to permit changes of the
cutters. To use, merely hold the splint ﬂat between the right hand
and stripper, press the strand down on the cutter and pull it across
the cutters with the left hand. Two persons may do the operation
more readily and speedily than one. It is a good policy to make
several of these devices with cutters at different distances apart so
