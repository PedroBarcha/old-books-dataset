is used. Each alternate row of each series is either over or under.
The ﬁrst diagonal strands run over the preceding two series. They
are not woven as in seven-step caning. The second diagonal strands
run over the ﬁrst diagonals and under the intersection of the other
strands, including every alternate ﬁrst diagonal. This resolves

periods. The application of cane as used today on French furniture,
as in panels, is historically wrong. However there can be no valid
objection to its use in panels if no attempt is made to name it a
true period style. Also it must be conceded that period furniture
was not always well designed, and there can be no well sustained
objection to the use of cane in panels, provided it is in keeping
structurally and decoratively with the particular piece of furniture.
