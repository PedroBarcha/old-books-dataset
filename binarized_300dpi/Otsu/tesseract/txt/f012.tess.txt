viii PREFA CE

from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.

No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. IV hen we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had O'laude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.

Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the diﬂiculty—the almost insupcrable (liﬂiculty
—of sifting fact from ﬁction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientiﬁc spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
