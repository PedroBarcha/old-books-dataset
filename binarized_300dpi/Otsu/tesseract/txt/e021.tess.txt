Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we ﬁnd
that other means besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java, and informs us that the reddish clay called “ampb” is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beauty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of proﬁting by its reducing
qualities persevere in its consumption. Loss of appetite and inability to
partake of more than most minute portions of food are not slow in
bringing the wished-for consummation about. The inhabitants of
Ceylon make a perfect study of the training of the ﬁgure to the most
slender proportions. Books on the subject are common in that country,
and no young lady is considered the perfection of fashionable elegance
unless a great number of qualities and graces are possessed; not the
least of these is at waist which can be quite or nearly claSped with the
two hands; and, as we proceed with our work, it will be seen that this
standard for the perfection of waist-measurement has been almost
world-wide. From the coral-fringed and palm-decked islands of the
Paciﬁc and Indian Oceanwe have but to travel to the grass-clad Yaila
of Crim Tartary and the rock-crowned fastnesses of Circassia, to see the
same tastes prevailing, and even more potent means in force for the
obtainment of a taper form. Any remarks from us as to the beauty of
the ladies of Circassia would be needless, their claim to that enviable
endowment being too well established to call for conﬁrmation at our
hands, and that no pains are spared in the formation of their ﬁgures
will be best seen by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the subject :—

“What would” (he says) “our ladies think of this fashion on the part
of the far-famed beauties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
‘1norocco,’ and furnished with two plates of wood placed on the chest,
