the corset or bodice——-a stiff and unnatural disguisement even in its
origin.”

How far this newly-introduced form of the corset became a “dis-
guisement” will be best judged of by a glance at the foregoing illustration,
which represents a lady in the dress worn just at the close of the
thirteenth century. The term surcoat was given.to this new introduc-
