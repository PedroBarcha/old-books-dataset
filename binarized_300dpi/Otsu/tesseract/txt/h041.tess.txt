“Isaac Horton moved from Colchester to Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y., 4 and 5 of April, 1826. The snow fell in April, after they
moved, about two feet deep. He had a large stock of cows, sheep and
hogs. In his ﬂock of sheep were twenty»two ewes, the ﬁnest that could be
found in Colchester, nearly all of them only two years old. He drove
them to Liberty. Wolves were seen on the way near Parkesville.
He arrived at Liberty Falls—salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the sheep were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got beyond
the clearing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence. and
others dying. Nearly all the ﬂock were killed. They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house.

“ In 1837, Isaac Horton had thirty-seven grandchildren, all living
but two. His children all lived to maturity.”—(Lelz‘er G. B. Horton,
1871.)

Isaac Horton was a member of the Baptist Church, of Colchester;
but after he moved to Liberty, Sullivan Co., N. Y., he usually attended
the Episcopal Church. He built a grist—mill at .Liberty Falls, in
I827 or 1828, another in 1841—42. He was quite extensively engaged
in the manufacture of bed-posts and other turned work, including
wooden bowls ,- also in shipping curled and birds-eyeZmaple. Politi-
cally he was a whig, and an ardent supporter of Clay and Webster.
He died 10 May, 1855. She is still living.

Under date of 8 February, 1874, Webb Horton writes, “ My mother
is living and in good health. She resides at Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y. She is in the eighty»seventh year of her age. Her father died
aged eighty-eight, and her grandmother, Prudence Schoﬁeld, aged
ninety-four. She has now living ten children, thirty-seven grand-
children, and nineteen great-grandchildren.”

This is a very remarkable family—so large and yet so few deaths.
