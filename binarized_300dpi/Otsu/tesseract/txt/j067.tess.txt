CHAPTER VII

SEATS or REEDS AND SPLINTS

The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools diﬁerent
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in—
stances it will be noted that weaving is done ovena separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of
possible other ones, and the individual worker will find that many
designs of varying complexity may be worked out. An evcellent
method for working out possible designs is that of using black and
white paper strips }6 in. in width. The design will show up very
clearly because of the contrast of the black and white. Experi-
menting with the weave on the seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. The paper strips are an excellent means to an end.

The stool top illustrated in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, utilizing ﬂat reed. The worker needs to decide at
the outset on the character of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design. In this instance the weaver runs over three and
under three strands, and the wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the operation tack an end of ﬂat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under:
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
