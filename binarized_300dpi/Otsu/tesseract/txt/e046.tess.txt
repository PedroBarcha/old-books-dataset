of which was £48,457,

Bracelets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are rings and
brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.

Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common use during
this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of
rank about the reign of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appears to have
taken place in the general style of costume for some very considerable
period of time, and the patrician ladies concealed beneath their ﬂowing
draperies a kind of corset, which they tightened very considerably, for a
slight and tapering waist was looked upon as a great beauty in women,
and great attention was paid to the formation of the ﬁgure, in spite of
all that has been written about the purely natural and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On the conquest of the Roman Empire by the
wild and savage Hunnish tribes, fashion, art, taste, literature, and civilisa-
tion were swept ruthlessly away, and a long, weird night of mental
darkness may be said to have reigned throughout the land from the
tenth to the middle of the ﬁfteenth century, and we see little or nothing

of Roman elegance or magniﬁcence of dress to distinguish it above other
nations from that period.
