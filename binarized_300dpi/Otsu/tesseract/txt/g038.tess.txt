32 HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF

“square fort with bastions” at what is now
called Barrancas, which he named San Carlos.
As the beginning, or rather reconstruction of a
town named Pensacola, he erected some houses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built
a church, historically the ﬁrst ever erected on
the shores of Pensacola Bay, but presumptively
the second; for it is hardly credible that the
- large settlement of de Luna, embracing so many
ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe the
universal custom of the Spaniards to build a
church wherever they planted a colony. Irre-
sistible, therefore, is the inference that the ﬁrst
notes of a church-bell heard within the limits of
the United States were those which rolled over
the waters of Pensacola Bay and the white
hills of Santa Rosa from 1559 to 1562.

Having demonstrated that the settlement of
de Luna was the original Pensacola, that of
Arriola was apparently the second, though
actually but a resuscitation of the colony of
1559; for the name, the people, though not the
same generation, and the place being one, mere

lapse of time should not be permitted to destroy
