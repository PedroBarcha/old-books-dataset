THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessity for slendemess of form in the belles of their nation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing—girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her ﬁgure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have conﬁned their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconﬁned.
That their doing so is more the result of long—established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned ﬁgures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in C/Jamlzerr’
yourzml, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Celestial Empire,
named Woo-tamzhin, who paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus

he describes the ladies of England :—

laced waists; nothing can possibly be so enchanting as to see ladies that
compress themselves into taper forms of the most exquisite shape, the

like of which I have never seen before.”
By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally

felt for slenderly—proportioned and taper waists results from an artiﬁcial
taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhin’s case it was
clearly not so, as the small-waisted young ladies of the “outer
barbarians” were to him much as some new and undescribed ﬂowers or
birds would be to the wondering naturalist who ﬁrst beheld them.
Although researches among the antiquities of Egypt and Thebes
fail to bring to our notice an article of dress corresponding with the
waist-bandage of Polenqui or the strophium of later times, we ﬁnd
