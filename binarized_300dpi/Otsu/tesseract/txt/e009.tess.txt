PREFACE.

THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of ﬁgurative
battle-ﬁeld, where ﬁerce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,
merely performing the part of the public’s “ own correspondent,” making
it our duty to gather together such extracts from despatches, both ancient
and modern, as may prove interesting or important, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, and, in ﬁne, to do our best
to lay clearly before our readers the historical facts—experiences and
arguments—relating to the much-discussed “ Corset question.”

As most of our readers are aware, the leading journals especially
intended for the perusal of ladies have been for many years the media
for the exchange of a vast number of letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable article of ladies’ attire, its construction,
application, and inﬂuence on the ﬁgure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
