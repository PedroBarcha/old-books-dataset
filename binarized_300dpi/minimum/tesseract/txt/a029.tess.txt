THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
ofBerlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Goyernments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording ofArticle 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood

(Armenian blood).

It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difﬁcult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
ofthe Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.

GENERAL PRINCE LOhIS MELIKOFF.

Commaudcd the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the ini-
prcgnable fortress of Kare. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoﬂ; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from ofﬁce early in the reign of Alexander HI.
