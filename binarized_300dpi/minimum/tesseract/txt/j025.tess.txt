CANING SUGGESTIONS 21

is necessary before the weaver feels conﬁdent of readily caning any
area of odd shape.

In weaving the diagonals it is frequently necessary to run several
in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just
when this should be done can only be determined by the worker.
A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree
out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of

step caning. The presumption should not be made that this weave
will in any way supplant the regular weave, but in instances where
decoration is the object, and not service particularly, this weave

Fig. 12 illustrates a frame caned with the five steps. The dis—
tance between holes was purposely made greater than usual, to

same manner as described in the seven steps. The second series of
