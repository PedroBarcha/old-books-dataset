10 SEAT WEAVING

the last space will be a short V2 in. or whatever dimension is used.
In such cases it is necessary to redivide the last several spaces into
divisions as near % in. as possible. It thus becomes obvious why
spacing must be done in one direction as stated. This applies to
all rectangular frames.

With a 3/16 in. wood bit bore holes thru the rails and stiles at
the points marked. Countersink the holes slightly on the underside

holes, and in other ways. In shops where

are for ﬁne-ﬁne cane. Use sandpaper to remove pencil lines and
rough edges left from boring; then clamp the frame over the edge
of a table or bench with a carriage clamp; sit while doing the
weaving.

The Seven Steps in (Inning—Fig. 4 shows the seven steps in
caning. Refer to this photograph thruout the following directions.
The numbers on the photograph refer to the steps.

Ste]: 1. A hank of cane should be soaked for a few minutes in

warm water, or longer in cold. Do not soak it too long. Start a
strand by drawing one end thru a holenext to a corner hole, and
let it project about 3 in. below. Fasten with a peg. Then starting
