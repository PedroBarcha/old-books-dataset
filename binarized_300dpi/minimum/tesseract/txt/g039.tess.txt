COLONIAL FLORIDA. 33

the two settlements.

The inhabitants of the town having been
largely recruited by malefactors banished from
Mexico, must be notched low in the scale of
morals. But, perhaps, in some instances at
least, actions were then adjudged crimes de-
serving banishment which might be deemed
virtues in a more enlightened age, and under free
institutions; for under the despotic colonial
governments of Spanish America in that age to
criticize the vices, or censure the lawless edicts
of a satrap, was a heinous offence, for which
transportation was but a mild punishment.

Originally, Spain’s dominion was asserted
over the entire circle of the shores of the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as over all the islands which
they girdled. But upon the voyage of La Salle
from the upper waters of the Mississippi to the
sea, France asserted a claim, under the name of
Louisiana, to the entire valley of the river from
its spring-heads to the Gulf, making to the ex-
tent of the southern limit of her claim, from
east to west, a huge gap in Spain’s North
American empire.
