When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
thatthemassacres 01 April, 1909, had been planned,

prepared, organized and carried into execution by

. _ 1J8
the Constitutional Government of what ha& been

called “Liberal Turks ” or “Young Turks.”
