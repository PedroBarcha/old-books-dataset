PREFACE

On the analogy of the famous apple,——“there ain’t
going to be no” preface, “not nohow.” Children do
not read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.

As for the grown-ups the story is not written for grown-
ups, and if they want to know Why it begins with such a
gruesome ﬁrst chapter, let them ask the children. Chil—
dren like the horrors ﬁrst and the end all bright. Many
grown-ups like the tragedy at the end. But perhaps the
children are right and the grown-ups are standing on
their heads. Besides they can skip the ﬁrst chapter; it is
only a prologue.
