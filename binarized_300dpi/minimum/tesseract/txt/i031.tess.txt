THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE

I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the ﬁrst list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from ﬁlling
through them.

On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her ﬁnal plunge any mo-
ment now, and as there was nothing more that
could be done on the port side—for there was
no discipline or order with which to do it—I
passed through to the starboard side. Men
were striving to lower the boats and were
putting women and children into them, but it
seemed to me that it only added horror to
the whole situation to put people into a
boat that you knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
