“ THOMAS DUN” I7

was hidden deliver a learned thesis. We ﬁnd
almost exactly parallel stories in Smith and
Johnson. In those pages it is Sir Josselin
(? J oscelin) Denville and his numerous band of
robbers, who, meeting a Benedictine monk in a
wood, make him preach a sermon in praise of
thieving. Captain Dudley, a hundred years or so
later, is represented demanding a sermon from a
clergyman.

More shadowy even than Robin Hood, is
“ Thomas Dun.” We may be in some reasonable
doubt as to the validity of many incidents and
biographies in the pages of Smith and Johnson,
but there is no possible doubt whatever that the
“Life of Thomas Dun” is what one of our own
eighteenth-century highwaymen and cutpurses
would have called a “ﬂam.” There was never
a Thomas Dun, highwayman, bandit, and murderer,
as depicted in those classic pages; but the fact
that he was a myth does not prevent those
painstaking authors from presenting us with a
very exact narrative of his deeds.

The curious “ moral reﬂection ” prefaced to
Thomas Dun’s entirely apocryphal adventures
is itself worth reproducing. It says: “ A man
who is not forced from necessity or a desire
of pleasure to become dishonest, but follows his
natural dispositions in robbing and maltreating
others, will generally be found to be destitute
of every humane and generous principle. So will
it be found with this character—a person of
mean extraction—who was born in Bedfordshire,
