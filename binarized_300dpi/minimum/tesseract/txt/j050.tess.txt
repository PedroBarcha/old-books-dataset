thereby making a tauter seat than could be woven with dry strands.
Inasmuch as the ﬁber is paper, it cannot be soaked in water.

The Weaving Process.—VVith the frame ready and rush in
proper condition the weaving may be started. Fig. 39 shows an
isometric drawing on which corners are lettered and the rails
numbered in order. Fig. 40 shows another drawing on which the
corners and rails are similarly lettered and numbered, showing
graphically the method of weaving the ﬁrst strand. The arrows
indicate the direction of weave. The operation is practically com<

drawing in the following detailed directions for weaving.

Start arbitrarily at any corner— in this case, A. A strand of
