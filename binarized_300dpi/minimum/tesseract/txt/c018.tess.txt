THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

iron door fast asleep, with the swords on the ground
before them. And the locks were off the door of
iron.

Just as they came there the iron door of the
stable opened and the King’s white horse was led
out. He who had the rein was a strange youth
dressed in a foreign dress. The youth was about
to spring on the horse’s back when those who were
with the King sprang upon him and held him and
held the bridle of the horse.

And having secured the youth they went into
the stable, and they found the red horse and the
black horse eating at their mangers. They led
the white horse back and put him in his own stall.
The watchers who had been before the stable
door could not be wakened, so those who were
with the King carried them to another place,
and left two others, the harper and the story—teller,
to keep watch, with the soldiers’ swords in their
hands. As for the youth who had tried to steal
the white horse, he was placed as has been told
you, and every one there knew what doom would

befall him.
