PREFACE TO 2ND PRINTING.

The ﬁrst and second parts of this little book were written and printed’
in pamphlet form for circulation in the United States, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April, 1909. I have now thought it advisable to add‘
a Supplement of a short history of the Origin of the Armenians and the

Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.

The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals “Harper’s

Monthly," “The Wide \Vorld ” and the “ Cosmopolitan " have been added.

to the 2nd printing.
